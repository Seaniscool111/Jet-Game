# Jet-Game
A 2D arcade-style game built using Python and Pygame. The project focuses on physics-based player movement, dynamic difficulty scaling, and state-driven game design.

## Features
- Physics-based movement (acceleration, friction, velocity)
- Multiple game states (start, pause, gameplay, game over)
- Dynamic level progression and difficulty scaling
- Persistent high-score tracking using file I/O
- Real-time sound effects and background music

## Technologies
- Python
- Pygame

## Controls
- Arrow Keys — Move
- Enter — Start / Restart
- ESC — Pause / Exit

## How to Run
```bash
pip install pygame
python main.py
